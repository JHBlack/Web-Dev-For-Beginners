# Analyze an inaccessible site

## Instructions

Identify a website that you believe is NOT accessible and create an action plan to improve its accessibility.
Your first task would be to identify this site, detail the ways in which you think it is inaccessible without using analytical tools, and then submit it to a Lighthouse analysis. Capture a pdf of the results of this analysis and outline a detailed plan with a minimum of ten points showing how the site could be improved.

## Table to test site accessibility

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Need to Improve |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
|          | missing <10% of what is required | missing 20% of what is required | missing 50% of what is required |

Student Report: For this project I analyzed the accessibility of https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/AU/before.html. I used lighthouse to measure the website's accessibility. It received an accessibilty score of 57 indicating that it doesn't meet satisfactory requirements for website visitors with disabilities. I would add alt attribute to the images. The form elements on the right do not have associated labels which can be fixed by adding those. The HTML document does not contain the Lang tag and the ARIA is unable to read the webpage in the right language.
