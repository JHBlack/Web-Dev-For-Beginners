An online shopping cart will need the following:
String: For product names.
Number/Integer: for the quantity of the product
Boolean: TO see if an item is added to the shopping cart, using a boolean value will be useful ex. TRUE if item is in cart; False if item is not in cart 
Bigint: This data type can be used to store product ID's
Undefined: undefined variables such as the product name before assigning a value to it.
Null: A NULL data type can be used to to describe an incomplete transaction. An example, someone tries to pay for the items in the cart but the transaction will read NULL if the credit card information was not entered correctly.
